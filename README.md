# Spectrm Challenge

Live version: https://trusting-borg-350895.netlify.app/

A simple app built using Vue that displays some data in the form of a donut chart. Each chart/widget displays the total data, individual data and has a legend to describe what the data represents. There is also a menu icon which displays a 'clone' button, which when clicked copies the chart and displays it at the bottom of the list. Once clicked, the original chart cannot be cloned again.

## Installation

Fork this repo and use the following command in your terminal:

```
  https://github.com/s-alex-smith/spectrm-challenge-react
```

Once open, install the necessary dependencies by using the following:

```
npm install
```

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

You will now be able to run the project locally on your desktop.

## Future improvements

This project was built within a time constraint, and so some functionality may not be as developed as I would normally like, for instance:

- add unit tests
- prevent the copied widget from being cloned
- accommodate different screen sizes
- host the data and access it via a GET request
